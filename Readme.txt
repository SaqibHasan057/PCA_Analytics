This is a django software project that I helped create where the user can get the latest trends on social media using an online version of the popular "Principal Component Analysis" algorithm that was developed in our lab.
The paper for the project is at "https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3374750".

How to run:
1. Install Python.
2. Install the requirements.txt using pip.
3. Run the django app using the command "python manage.py runserver" using terminal.
